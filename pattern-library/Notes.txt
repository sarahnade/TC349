Design 1:

I like this design because it’s very clean. I think all of the fonts used compliment each other nicely. The links at the top of the page look really great as well. If I could change one thing about the design it would be the color of the button at the bottom of the page. It does not seem to fit with the rest of the design.

Design 2:

The credit card text bubble in this design is very clever. I think the bold and almost bubbly font compliments the design well. There is a subtle gradient applied to the credit card bubble and I think it kind of makes the text appear flat and boring by comparison, as the text has no gradient. I like the simplicity of this logo, but I feel that something needs to be done to the text in order to make it look complete.

Design 3:

My favorite thing about this “Groove Helpdesk” design is the sidebar on the left. Everything is very subtle and clean. The flag system for the tickets is also very simple and effective and fits nicely into the design. The only thing that bothers me a bit about this design is that the text in the third column, used for responses, is not as dark as it should be to be easily legible. I assume that the designer was trying to keep up the subtlety but at least a slightly darker color could have been used.
