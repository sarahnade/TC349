        <h1>Design Principles</h1>

        <h2>1.) Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>
          <h3>Good: Tumblr</h3>
            <img id="tumblr-noise" alt="tumblr-good-stn-ratio" src="img/goodstntumblr.png">
            <!-- Marketing Land: http://marketingland.com/tumblr-launches-in-stream-mobile-ads-today-ahead-of-desktop-40943 -->
            <p>Tumblr incorporates adds by occasionally mixing sponsored posts into the user's dashboard. Often times, the sponsored posts are actually creative and fairly interesting. These posts are not obnoxiously frequent and blend in very seamlessly with the content the user is truly interested in seeing.</p>
          <h3>Bad: NME</h3>
            <img alt="nme-bad-stn-ratio" src="img/badstnnme.jpg">
            <!-- NME: http://www.nme.com/ -->
            <p>These advertisements take up a third of the page and are larger than most of the article links on the website. This makes it more difficult to focus on the content that the user actually wants to see.</p>

        <h2>2.) Ockham's Razor</h2>
          <h3>Good: VSCO Grid</h3>
            <img alt="vsco-good-ockhams-razor" src="img/goodockhamvsco.png">
            <!-- VSCO Grid: http://grid.vsco.co/grid/1 -->
            <p>This design is extremely minimal, allowing users to focus on the photography. A more cluttered design could distract users and would be a less effective choice.</p>
          <h3>Bad: Portfolio</h3>
            <img alt="portfolio-bad-ockhams-razor" src="img/badockhamrikcat.png">
            <!-- Portfolio: http://www.rikcat.com/ -->
            <p>This design works much better when the user is viewing the artist's work, however the home page comes across very dull and boring. Even as a fan of minimal design, I find this unappealing.</p>

        <h2>3.)Chunking</h2>
          <h3>Good: Last.fm</h3>
            <img alt="lastfm-good-chunking" src="img/goodchunkinglastfm.jpg">
            <!-- Last.fm: http://www.last.fm/ -->
            <p>Last.fm presents detailed information about the artists you listen to by breaking down your listening habits. This information is presented through chunking, breaking it up into different sections so it is more easily digestible.</p>
          <h3>Bad: Rudgwick Steam and Country Show</h3>
            <img alt="rudgwick-bad-chunking" src="img/badchunkingrudgwick.jpg">
            <!-- Web Pages that Suck: http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/worst-websites-of-2013.html -->
            <p>Aside from the fact that the site is hideous, it is also incredibly unorganized. The information is all over the place and difficult to process.</p>

        <h2>4.) Affordance</h2>
          <h3>Good: Twitter</h3>
            <img alt="twitter-good-affordance" src="img/goodaffordancetwitter.png">
            <!-- Twitter: https://twitter.com/ -->
            <p>Even if this search form didn't specifically say "search twitter," it would be easy to assume that that form was clickable, as the different color makes the search area apparent.</p>
          <h3>Bad: Interpunk</h3>
            <img alt="interpunk-bad-affordance" src="img/badaffordanceinterpunk.png">
            <!-- Interpunk: http://www.interpunk.com/ -->
            <p>Typically the user expects any logo in the upper left of the page to be clickable and allow them to return to the homepage. On the Interpunk website the text logo is clickable, but the skull logo is not.</p>

        <h2>5.) Mapping</h2>
          <h3>Good:</h3>
            <img alt="songkick-good-mapping" src="img/goodmappingsongkick.png">
            <!--Songkick: https://www.songkick.com -->
            <p>Song kick allows you to see the concert plans your friend has made via the dashboard, concerts taking place for artists you follow, your current concert plans, or concerts specific to any of the locations you have selected. The way their navagation is layed out is common sense.</p>
          <h3>Bad:Bad Designs</h3>
            <img alt="bad-designs-bad-mapping" src="img/badmappingbaddesigns.png">
            <!-- Bad Designs: http://www.baddesigns.com/examples.html -->
            <p>Considering the name of the site, this could possibly be intentional. However, the various lists of links are organized, but not in an easily digestable way. Many of the links under certain categories could fit into the other categories, making this a poorly mapped site.</p>

        <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/vendor/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
        <script src="js/plugins.js"></script>
        <script src="js/main.js"></script>

        <!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. -->
        <script>
            (function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
            function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;
            e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];
            e.src='//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';
            r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));
            ga('create','UA-XXXXX-X');ga('send','pageview');
        </script>
    </body>
